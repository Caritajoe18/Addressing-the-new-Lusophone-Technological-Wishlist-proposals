# Steps Taken  

1. Converted the date into a readable format using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.  
2. Iterated through the array of data objects using the `map` function.  
3. Destructured each object to extract the `title`, `page_id`, and `creation_date`.  
4. Appended an alphabetical bullet point to each entry using ASCII character codes.  
5. Formatted the extracted data into a structured sentence.  
6. Appended the formatted results to the results paragraph.  
7. Separated each entry with a new line for better readability.
